  description: |-
    Returns a [paginated](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/#pagination) list of [notification schemes](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/8YdKLg) in order by display name.

    ### About notification schemes

    A notification scheme is a list of events and recipients who will receive notifications for those events. The list is contained within the `notificationSchemeEvents` object and contains pairs of `events` and `notifications`:

    *   `event` Identifies the type of event. The events can be [Jira system events](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/8YdKLg#Creatinganotificationscheme-eventsEvents) or [custom events](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/AIlKLg).
    *   `notifications` Identifies the [recipients](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/8YdKLg#Creatinganotificationscheme-recipientsRecipients) of notifications for each event. Recipients can be any of the following types:

    *   `CurrentAssignee`
    *   `Reporter`
    *   `CurrentUser`
    *   `ProjectLead`
    *   `ComponentLead`
    *   `User` (the `parameter` is the user key)
    *   `Group` (the `parameter` is the group name)
    *   `ProjectRole` (the `parameter` is the project role ID)
    *   `EmailAddress`
    *   `AllWatchers`
    *   `UserCustomField` (the `parameter` is the ID of the custom field)
    *   `GroupCustomField`(the `parameter` is the ID of the custom field)

    _Note that you should allow for events without recipients to appear in responses._

    **[Permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/FQiiLQ) required:** None, however the requesting user must have permission to administer at least one project associated with a notification scheme for it to be returned.

    ### About permission schemes and grants

    A permission scheme is a collection of permission grants. A permission grant consists of a `holder` and a `permission`.

    #### Holder

    The `holder` object contains information about the user or group being granted the permission. For example, the _Administer projects_ permission is granted to a group named _Teams in space administrators_. In this case, the type is `"type": "group"`, and the parameter is the group name, `"parameter": "Teams in space administrators"`. The `holder` object is defined by the following properties:

    *   `type` Identifies the user or group (see the list of types below).
    *   `parameter` The value of this property depends on the `type`. For example, if the `type` is a group, then you need to specify the group name.

    The following `types` are available. The expected values for the `parameter` are given in parenthesis (some `types` may not have a `parameter`):

    *   `anyone` Grant for anonymous users.
    *   `applicationRole` Grant for users with access to the specified application (application name). See [Manage application access](https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/manage-application-access-744721629.html) for more information.
    *   `assignee` Grant for the user currently assigned to an issue.
    *   `group` Grant for the specified group (group name).
    *   `groupCustomField` Grant for a user in the group selected in the specified custom field (custom field ID).
    *   `projectLead` Grant for a project lead.
    *   `projectRole` Grant for the specified project role (project role ID).
    *   `reporter` Grant for the user who reported the issue.
    *   `sd.customer.portal.only` Jira Service Desk only. Grants customers permission to access the customer portal but not Jira. See [Customizing Jira Service Desk permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/24dKLg) for more information.
    *   `user` Grant for the specified user (user ID).
    *   `userCustomField` Grant for a user selected in the specified custom field (custom field ID).

    Updates a permission scheme. Below are some important things to note when using this resource:

    *   If a permissions list is present in the request, then it will be set in the permission scheme, overwriting _all existing_ grants.
    *   If you want to update only the name and description, then do not send a permissions list in the request.
    *   Sending an empty list will remove all permission grants from the permission scheme.

    If you want to add or delete a single permission grant instead of updating the whole list, see [Create permission grant](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/#api-api-2-permissionscheme-schemeId-permission-post) or [Delete permission scheme entity](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/#api-api-2-permissionscheme-schemeId-permission-permissionId-delete). See [About permission schemes and grants](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/#about-permission-schemes) for more details. **[Permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/FQiiLQ) required:** _Administer Jira_ global permission.

- name: Jira Cloud REST API - Get all project roles
  x-api-slug: api2role-get
  description: |-
    Gets a list of all project roles, complete with project role details and default actors.

    ### About project roles

    [Project roles](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/3odKLg) are a flexible way to to associate users and groups with projects. In Jira Cloud, the list of project roles is shared globally with all projects, but each project can have a different set of actors associated with it (unlike groups, which have the same membership throughout all Jira applications).

    Project roles can be used in [permission schemes](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/#api-api-2-permissionscheme-get), [email notification schemes](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/#api-api-2-notificationscheme-get), [issue security levels](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/#api-api-2-issuesecurityschemes-get), [comment visibility](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/#api-api-2-comment-list-post), and workflow conditions.

    #### Members and actors

    In the Jira REST API, a member of a project role is called an _actor_. An _actor_ is a group or user associated with a project role.

    Actors may be set as [default members](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/3odKLg#Managingprojectroles-Specifying'defaultmembers'foraprojectrole) of the project role or set at the project level:

    *   Default actors: Users and groups that are assigned to the project role for all newly created projects. The default actors can be removed at the project level later if desired.
    *   Actors: Users and groups that are associated with a project role for a particular project, which may differ from the default actors. This allows you to assign a particular user to different roles in different projects.
